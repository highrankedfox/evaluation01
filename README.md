# evaluation01
Very first evaluation done for Digital Campus Live as part of my graduate developer program. 
Requirements were to develop a two pages minimum website for an association, including an event page and using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap Framework.
This is a non-existing Shiba Inu themed association, all images are free of use.
